Table of Contributors
=======

The following table should give an overview about the competence fields of each contributor.

The development of the final prototype and its documentation did not take place in separation of tasks, but more in a constant exchange and collaboration of all contributors, therefore a tabular division is difficult. Nevertheless, we try to give an overview of the core tasks of each contributor in the following but again it does not represent the elaboration of the QSROA.
